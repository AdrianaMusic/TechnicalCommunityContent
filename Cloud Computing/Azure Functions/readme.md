# Community Content - Azure Functions

This folder contains content introducing Azure Functions and demonstrating how to use them to write code that runs in the cloud. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Azure Functions (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.

In addition, we also would like to share with you some great Azure Functions content that was produced by one of our Microsoft Technical Evangelists in Greece.

The following blog post demonstrates an implementation of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline of a multi-container app using a Kubernetes cluster running on Azure Container Service with Visual Studio Team Services Build and Release Management:

We believe this can be great additional content for your community events.
